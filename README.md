```text
├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Navbar, Section, etc.)
├── App.tsx             # Main layout and section orchestration
├── constants.ts        # CENTRAL DATA FILE - Update your resume info here

## Customization

To update the website with your latest achievements, you only need to modify **one file**:

1. Open `constants.ts`.
2. Update the `PERSONAL_INFO` object (Email, Education, etc.).
3. Add or edit entries in `EXPERIENCES`, `PROJECTS`, and `PUBLICATIONS` arrays.
4. The UI will automatically update to reflect your changes.

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder, which can be hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
